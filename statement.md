> This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, which performs character substitution using modular arithmetic to encrypt and decrypt text based on a numeric shift value.
> This program illustrates the working principle of the Caesar Cipher, a classical encryption technique where each letter in a message is replaced by another letter fixed positions away in the alphabet.
> Inspired by Julius Caesar’s military secret codes, this Python program encrypts and decrypts text by shifting letters across the alphabet using a key.
