# Caesar-Cipher-encryption-and-decryption-program
A python program for encrypting and decrypting using a complex cipher known as Caesar Cipher

✨ Overview
-------------------------------
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.
It works by shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

🚀 Features
------------------------------
✔ Supports Encryption and Decryption
✔ Works with custom shift values
✔ Handles uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and punctuation
✔ Prevents character loss with alphabet wrapping
✔ Beginner-friendly and extendable

🧠 How It Works
------------------------------
The cipher shifts each character using this formula:

Encrypted = (CharacterIndex + Shift) mod 26
Decrypted = (CharacterIndex - Shift) mod 26

Where:

CharacterIndex is position in alphabet (A=0, B=1, ...)

Shift is the rotation number (key)

🎯 Real-World Use Cases
---------------------------------
Although no longer secure for serious cryptography, Caesar Cipher helps in:

Teaching fundamentals of encryption

Introduction to modular arithmetic

Building escape room puzzles

Creating hidden messages and games

💡 Fun Fact
--------------------------------
This cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to protect military messages in ancient Rome. 🏛🗡
